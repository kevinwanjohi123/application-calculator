    <h1>My date of birth application calculator!</h1>
    <p>Imagine a scenario where you just input your date of birth
      and pop!  just like that Alladin the genie from his magical hiding place
      ...haha that magical lamp.I wonder how he could fit in such a small realm,
      anyway maybe that's where jinns habitate...who knows? Back to our application
      magical moments, <em><b>the day of the week you were born</b></em> and that strange <em><b>Akan name</b></em> given to you
      by your dictative ancestors after letting out that  babyish annoying first cry under the sun.
